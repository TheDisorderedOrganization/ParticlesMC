<p align="center">
ParticlesMC is a Julia package for performing atomic and molecular Monte Carlo simulations. It is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, making it suitable for both research and educational purposes. Built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/TheDisorderedOrganization/Arianna.jl"> Arianna </a> module, it leverages Ariannaâ€™s Monte Carlo framework.

## Features

- **Flexible execution**: Simulations can be run from standalone scripts or through a command-line interface (CLI), enabling easy integration into workflows.
- **Interaction potentials**: Supports a broad range of interatomic and intermolecular interaction potentials.
- **Monte Carlo moves**: Implements state-of-the-art Monte Carlo moves for both atomic and molecular simulations.
- **Computational efficiency**: Designed with performance in mind to enable fast simulations.
- **Arianna framework integration**: Leverages the [Arianna](https://github.com/TheDisorderedOrganization/Arianna.jl) Monte Carlo framework, benefiting from advanced techniques such as Policy-Guided Monte Carlo (PGMC) and parallel tempering (soon).


## Installation

### Requirements
- Julia version 1.9 or higher

### Installing ParticlesMC
After the 1st release, you will be able to install ParticlesMC using the Julia package manager in one of two ways:

1. Using the package mode (press `]` in the Julia REPL):
```julia
add ParticlesMC
```

2. Using the Pkg API:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ParticlesMC")
```

### Building ParticlesMC

I you want to build `ParticlesMC`, enter the package mode (press `]` in the Julia REPL) and type:
```julia
build
```
This will build the `particlesmc` executable at `~/.julia/bin` (please add this path to your PATH).

## Usage

### Running a Monte Carlo Simulation

To run a Monte Carlo simulation, you need to define the systems and moves, and then use the provided functions to execute the simulation. Here is a basic example:

Add example code
```julia
```
